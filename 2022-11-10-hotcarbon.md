With uniform densification of base-stations, the dependency on power amplifiers to transmit at unreasonble high powers reduces and opens the doors for greener wireless networks. Checkout our short HotCarbon’22 workshop paper which shows empirical models on correct densification levels! Currently, we are building a small university wide-testebed with densified Massive MIMO testbed and looking for collaborations for the same.
