osd: "Our dataset consists of wireless channels and interfering bit-rate transmissions from 2, 3, 4 interfering users collected in a conference room setting with upto 8 antennas. This dataset can be used to evaluate performance of interfering suprresion schemes. Further, we show a simulation framework that creates signal processing for Massive MIMO upto 256 RF chains, as well as power consumption models from a standard digital beamformer and a hybrid beamformer."

Today, wireless base-stations consume a lot of power and contribute significantly to the carbon footprint of wireless industry (1.4%), which compares to that of aviation industry (2%). Further, with next-generation networks connecting more users, and even more devices, the power consumption is only going to increase, with more antennas and more data backhauling required. GreenMO virtualizes a single high bandwidth RF chain over multiple antennas to create a best of both worlds solution which is as power efficient as OFDMA and as spectral efficient as massive MIMO. We design a custom PCB which can allows for 4 users multiplexing via 8 antennas connnected to a single RF chain of WARPv3 SDR, and show upto 40% power savings compared to a existing 5G NR Massive MIMO base station.
